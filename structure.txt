Verse:
Gm - - - Cm7 - - - Gm - - - Gm - - -

Chorus:
Eb - Dm7 - Gm - - -


Notes:
G Bb C D F

+ Eb on the Eb chord (but not really necessary)

In chuck sequence of half-notes:
verse = [0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0]x2
chorus = [2 3 4 4]x4

so 1 time through verse and chorus = 16 bars = 4 x 4bar pattern
2 times through = 8 x 4bar patterns
